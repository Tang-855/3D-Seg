# Crop3D

**Crop3D: A Comprehensive Unsupervised Segmentation Framework for Crop Point Cloud under Limited Labeling Conditions**

-  Innovation: We introduced a two-stage unsupervised segmentation framework (***Crop-3D***) to alleviate the challenge of leaf ear segmentation in wheat and rice point clouds. The framework is mainly composed of four modules: adaptive point cloud transformation, global similarity, intra-class similarity, and inter-class separation.

##         

## On rice and wheat point clouds, Crop3D showed a significant improvement in segmentation performance

**Wheat**
-  Under the 10 sample sizes of [10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%], the segmentation performance of *DGCNN, Point Cloud Transformer, PointNet++, PointNeXt, PointMLP* and *PointConv* based on fully supervised learning and ***Crop-3D*** has been improved to varying degrees.

## Module Introduction
***Crop-3D*** consists of four major componentsï¼š
[**OpenPoints**](https://github.com/guochengqian/openpoints). 

1. **Adaptive point cloud branching transformation**: randomly selects a combination of rotation, scaling and translation strategies in a local neighborhood to generate branching point clouds with similar global semantic features;
   
2. **Global similarity module**: calculates the similarity of two branching point clouds on a global scale;

3. **Intra-class similarity module**: evaluates the similarity between each neighboring point and the sample centroid in the same superpoint by constructing a loss function in the KNN grouped neighborhood;

4. **Inter-class similarity module**: unsupervised clustering grouping through clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means++), initial clustering superpoints based on the realization of the three-dimensional coordinate features of the two branch point clouds, based on the fusion of the three-dimensional coordinate features and high-dimensional features, to complete further iterative clustering process

## Installation
We provide a simple bash file to install the environment:

```
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:guochengqian/PointNeXt.git
cd PointNeXt
source update.sh
source install.sh
```
Cuda-11.3 is required. Modify the `install.sh` if a different cuda version is used. See [Install](docs/index.md) for detail. 



## Usage 
Check our [online documentation](https://guochengqian.github.io/PointNeXt/) for detailed instructions. 

A short instruction: all experiments follow the simple rule to train and test: 

```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=$GPUs python examples/$task_folder/main.py --cfg $cfg $kwargs
```
- $GPUs is the list of GPUs to use, for most experiments (ScanObjectNN, ModelNet40, S3DIS), we only use 1 A100 (GPUs=0)
- $task_folder is the folder name of the experiment. For example, for s3dis segmentation, $task_folder=s3dis
- $cfg is the path to cfg, for example, s3dis segmentation, $cfg=cfgs/s3dis/pointnext-s.yaml
- $kwargs are the other keyword arguments to use. For example, testing in S3DIS area 5, $kwargs should be `mode=test, --pretrained_path $pretrained_path`.
